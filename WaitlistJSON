    //It is not clear at this time if we will consume the Watilist JSON and match it to Entities.
    //The "referralCode" will be mannually entered into C7 upon creation of a new customer.  Later a Zappier process maybe written to insert the code on the customer.
    //It may come to pass that Senzing becomes the system of truth for connecting "pledges" to their "sponor/hosts"
    // As of 06/21 there is no plan ingest the waitlist JSON and match/connect entities based on this source data.  (We should think hard about it, because it could 
    // be a powerful way to look at invitation / relationship conversion.
